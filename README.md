# Letter Recognition for Autistic People

This open source project is made for Autistic People who has difficulties in writing letters. Using the touch screen or pen they can practice the Letters, words and also can have a option to listen to those words and also few general things who's name starts from that letter.

## About Autism

> Autism spectrum disorder impacts the nervous system and affects the overall cognitive, emotional, social and physical health of the affected individual. The range and severity of symptoms can vary widely. Common symptoms include difficulty with communication, difficulty with social interactions, obsessive interests and repetitive behaviours.Early recognition, as well as behavioural, educational and family therapies may reduce symptoms and support development and learning.

This project is a web based solution to help them practice the letter writing and speaking through touch screen.

# Must have features!

  - Should follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)
  - User should be able to draw the letters using Touch Screen
  - Text to Speech for letters and realted words
  - images/png files realted to the items who's name starts from that letter
  - Machine Learning Approach
  - User friendly User Interface
  - Parent/Guardian role to track the process

### Future enhancements:
  - Cross Platform App (Most probably in flutter)
  - Panic Button and Medicin reminder for autistic person that send alerts to the Guardian
  - Meet-n-greet option
